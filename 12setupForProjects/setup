// Making a tsconfig file 
: tsc --init 
- This will create a config file for ts like an boiler plate for all the options and functions of ts


// Making a package.json // For node projects
- type npm init -y    // -y will not ask much and make a quick package.json file


// src and dist
- src: is a common standard to keep the main code files [angular, reacts etc]
- dist [distribution]: has the files for productions which is served to the end user
* These 2 folders are automatically generated after you configer the options in the tsconfig file
* Or you can generate them manually in the terminal [mkdir src dist] or right click make folder


// How we use the generated ts file compiled to js
- In this folder we have a index.html file where we have given a script tag with a src to the directory of js file 
- so whatever ts code which in src gets compiled generates a js file in dist which is then used or served to/by the index.html
- But we need to do some configuration in tsconfig.json file for that to happen


// Configuring tsconfig.json File
* Output Directory [for compiled files (js)] : outDir
- outDir takes the path to which the js files generated after ts compiled files
- so whenever the compilation of the ts files is done the generated file will go to the dist folder


NOTE: compiling the ts file right now like normmal We will not get our generated file in the dist folder, it will be generated in the src folder
      where our index.ts file is


// Compiling TS code without mentioning root directory of the src codes
- tsc -w
- This cmd will compile and watch every file and changes in it [Any changes in the code it will compile again and make the changes accordingly]
- This all also work based on the tsconifig file 
* Using this command we will have out js file generated in the dist folder      


// rootDir Option
- This option take the directory to the main ts file in which you are writing your code
- So whenever you enable this option by giving it the directory to the file 
- You can just type "tsc"and it will compile the code automatically and you don't need to type 'tsc ./src/index.ts'
