# TS is Uses Static Typing unlike JS Which uses dynamic Typing

- Static: In a strict way [Defining the type of variable : number, string ,etc]
- Dyinamic: No rules [defining varibles with any specific type]

ex: let age: number = 20;  [Here we are telling ts that this varible can contain only numbers]

WRONG: age = "20"

# DEBUGGING In TS
1. In the config file you can enable [source map option] to create a map file There you will find mappings which is not for us to understand


2. In vs code Go to debbugging section and create a launch.json file with node js
-  In this file below the program key-pair put another key-pair.
-  "preLaunchTask" : "tsc: build - tsconfig.json"  [Type this exactly the same] 

    [ What you need to put is path to the js file of the tsconfig.json] file
    ex : "tsc: build - hello-world/tsconfig.json"

- In this debugging section you run your code line by line


NOTE: add a breakpoint in the line of code from where you want to start debugging [In the left side]
